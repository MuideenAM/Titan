                                Titan Rodent Control ensures all visible entry points will be sealed upon the initial service to exclude rodents from the property, while leaving baited
traps to catch any rodents on site. Should any entry points become visible during a scheduled follow-up visit, the technician will seal it at no additional
charge. Customers should note that it may take time to control any infestation or catch rodents in any traps, sometimes taking two-to-three weeks or
not at all. Interior treatments may prove longer for total control, depending on the parameters of the job. No guarantee is given on proofing work or
trapping services outside of the 30-day warranty. Should there be any questions or concerns for ongoing issues, please refer to the technician on site.

scientific evidence there are no appreciable risks if proper use conditions are followed or that the risks are outweighed by the benefits. The degree of
risk depends upon the degree of exposure, so exposure should be minimized. If within 24 hours following application you experience symptoms similar
